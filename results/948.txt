Such will certainly be the case with any new American plan to acquire strategic superiority. In short, the real present danger is not a ''soft'' line but an unholy axis, even if inadvertent, between American and Soviet hard-liners, and a renewed cold war and arms race that will undermine progressive forces on both sides. ;;;
