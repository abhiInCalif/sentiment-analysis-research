Doing so under airport conditions shows extraordinary powers to concentrate despite the most trying conditions and must be applauded even by the most skilled veterans of great airport meetings. I well recall, for example, the great airport meeting in which I participated with the distinguished political philosopher, Art Buchwald, at the Atlanta airport in 1979. ;;;
