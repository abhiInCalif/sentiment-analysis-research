Text:::  How ironic that the Palestinian issue, while reflecting legitimate needs of a suffering people, is spotlighted in a region where the plights of other minorities have been neglected.

The numerous ethnic, linguistic and religious difference in the Middle East have been consistently ignored in discussions and policy concerning the region. ;;;
