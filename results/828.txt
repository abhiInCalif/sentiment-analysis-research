Text::: Terrorist acts are a natural ingredient in these liberation wars, as in Vietnam and in the Palestine Liberation Organization's strategy, and they are justified in Moscow's eyes as contributions to the guerrillas' eventual seizure of power.

Are all terrorist acts to be charged to Moscow's account as further cases of ''misbehavior'' that must cease before Washington is willing to talk about arms limitation or credits? ;;;
