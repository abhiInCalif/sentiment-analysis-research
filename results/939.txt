Text::: During the six weeks that I have been here, at least two men - Nazir Abbasi, who was suspected of distributing opposition literature, and Inayat Masih, a Christian trade unionist who demanded better safety measures after two maskless sanitation workers had died of asphyxiation while cleaning a sewer - have died under torture. There are other ironies in General Zia's being a spokesman for the Palestinians' cause on behalf of the Islamic nations. First, in 1970, during the Jordanian civil war, he led the Pakistani military contingent against the Palestine Liberation Organization. ;;;
