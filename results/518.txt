Text::: Their silence then and vociferous criticism now persuades many Turks that they are concerned less with eliminating torture than with making a political point. Unlike its predecessors, the current Turkish Government has acknowledged the existence of torture, and dozens of officals have been prosecuted - and convicted. One prison warden was sentenced to death for participating in the torture of a prisoner and most recently, in late July, a prison doctor and an army captain and sergeant were sentenced to 25 to 32 years by a criminal court in a torture case. ;;;
