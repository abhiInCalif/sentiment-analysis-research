Text::: Reward was soon forthcoming in a scene I had never before noticed. In this scene the mummy is strolling about a museum in his smashing new haberdashery when he encounters the archeologist who has dug him up. Naturally the archeologist doesn't recognize the mummy in those elegant clothes, nor does he notice anything odd about him although we, the audience, have noticed that the mummy's eyeballs tend to glow like the high beams on automobile headlights now and then. ;;;
