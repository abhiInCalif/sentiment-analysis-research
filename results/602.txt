Text:::  Lebanese President Amin Gemayel has brought home from Damascus the kind of ''peace for our time'' that Neville Chamberlain brought home from Munich. The American-sponsored withdrawal agreement with Israel is to be torn up; the Syrian forces or proxies are to remain in control in the territory they now occupy; and the delicate balance between Christians and Moslems that once made possible a free, Western-oriented Lebanese state is supposed to be tilted toward Moslem dominance. His attempt to negotiate peace at any price may backfire. ;;;
