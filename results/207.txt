Text::: Israel's best interest was thought to be in stalemate, neither side winning but Iran with the upper hand; that meant Arab military power would be sapped and Arab attention drawn away from Israel. Had it not been for the Israeli strike at the Iraqi atomic bomb plant in 1981, Teheran would be a radioactive cinder today with three million Persians dead. The U.S. knew all about Israel's tilt, and the reasons for it, including the presence of 50,000 Jews in Iran. ;;;
