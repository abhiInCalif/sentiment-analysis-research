Text::: Figaro claims that by 2015 ''non-European foreigners'' will dominate France, destroy its culture, make Islam its prevailing religion and tip it ''over into the third world unless something is done now.'' Recruitment of foreign workers was halted years ago and immigration is tightly controlled, so putting the issue as a matter of border surveillance is a euphemism. What the National Front proposes is to cut off social security and other non-discriminating rights and benefits for these ''foreigners'' in an attempt to drive them out. ;;;
