Text::: After all, historically Hassan has been the aggressor, driving hundreds of thousands of Saharans from their villages and attempting to annex their land. Today, the United States is the only major power still selling arms to the King, while the Saharan state gains worldwide recognition and Hassan is condemned throughout the third world and in Europe. America's loyalty to Morocco is based on the globalist theory that by supporting Hassan we are protecting his strategically situated country from Libya and Algeria, and therefore from the Soviet Union. ;;;
