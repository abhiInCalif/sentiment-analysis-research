Text::: The critical element in a workable peace scenario would be some form of internationally supervised cease-fire during which factionridden Afghan tribal and political leaders could begin to regroup in preparation for negotiations with the present regime and the phased evolution of a new government that would not be tainted by Soviet sponsorship.
