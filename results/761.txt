Text::: Attempting to play the moderate, Hassan has offered a referendum on continued Moroccan rule to the 75,000 people still living in Western Sahara but refuses to acknowledge the existence of almost 750,000 Western Saharan refugees scattered throughout Northern Africa. He also refuses to recognize or negotiate with Polisario, the Saharans' political and military organization. A week in a Polisario camp in Algeria - I was there in August - reinforces doubts about America's part in the conflict. ;;;
