Text::: Then Premier Bazargan and now President Bani-Sadr and their Western-educated allies believed they could work with the Ayatollah and 50,000 mullahs in reshaping Iran along vaguely leftist and democratic lines. They failed, however, to weld alliances with other secular leftwing parties or with what was left of the armed forces and they have been hopelessly outmaneuvered.Mr. Bani-Sadr depends pathetically on the undefined power of the 81-year-old Imam in Qum - and so does Iran. ;;;
