Text::: Arab capital is caricatured both as a ''weapon'' and as what makes the ''Arabs'' and ''Islam'' synonomous with conspicuously unjustified wealth. Arab capital makes possible the paradox by which American foreign policy extracts concessions from the Arabs, grants illusory promises of friendship along with functionless arms supplies, and at the same time shows a total unwillingness to rein in Israel, even after its record of lawlessness and harm to American interests has become awesome. What could be more insulting to those Arab states that have repeatedly, even excessively, placed their trust in American fairness than American declarations that Israel ''may have'' violated the Arms Export Control Act? ;;;
