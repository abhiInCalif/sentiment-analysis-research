Text:::  There is this much to celebrate in the release of the Rev. Lawrence Jenco after 19 months of captivity in Lebanon: He is alive, if in uncertain health; his joy is an elixir, and he brings news about three remaining American hostages. He also carries a videotaped plea from one of them, David Jacobsen, who says - or was made to say - that unless Washington negotiates, the other hostages will be murdered. ;;;
