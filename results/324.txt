Text::: Congress does not seem to grasp that the makings of an ominous change are gathering in the Middle East. Iran is beginning to win its war-to-the-death with Iraq; President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a moderate leader, is increasingly challenged at home by radicals; and oil revenues, which account for most of Saudi Arabia's leverage in the Arab world and provide an essential prop for all oil-rich monarchies, are falling precipitously. If the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fanatical legions defeat Iraq, the road to Tel Aviv could run through Riyadh. ;;;
