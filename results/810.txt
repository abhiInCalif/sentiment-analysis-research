Text:::  Isolated from his neighboring Arab brethren for his peace initiative with Israel, embarrassed by Prime Minister Menachem Begin's bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor and faced with mounting opposition from the Socialist Labor Party in Egypt, the last thing President Anwar el-Sadat anticipated was an internal conflict that would threaten Egyptian national unity. Yet, this is exactly what happened on June 18 when a quarrel between two Egyptians, a Moslem and a Christian Copt, over whether a vacant tract of Government land should be used for a church or a mosque degenerated into a major sectarian confrontation. By official count, the incident, which took place in Zawayah Hamra, one of Cairo's poor, crowded quarters, resulted in 16 dead, 40 injured, 166 detained and 37 firearms confiscated. ;;;
