Instead of a crushing victory, Iran's commanders may now be thinking of making progressive encroachments into Iraqi territory and facing the Iraqis with high casualty rates if they counterattack. In these circumstances the conflict could go on for years, and it will be important for the international community to make it more difficult and costly for Iran to persist in this incremental strategy. ;;;
