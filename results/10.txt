Text::: Moreover, last November, Mr. Cokely accused North Side Jewish merchants, on the 49th anniversary of ''Crystal Night'' - the night the Nazis vandalized Jewish shops, offices and synagogues - of breaking their own windows in order to gain sympathy for themselves. Black leaders' failure to repudiate Mr. Cokely has underscored their willingness to tap into what they identify as a current of anti-Jewish feeling in their community. What's amazing is that, no matter how wild the charges, they all drop one by one into a void of near-quiet. ;;;
