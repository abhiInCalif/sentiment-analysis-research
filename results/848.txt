That Israel can fly in virtually at will, pick its target, bomb as it pleases, tamper with internal politics, subsidize renegade or secessionist militias, allow itself to decide what Arab civilian population, technology, or political formulation is a potential threat - and all this with little Arab defense, except for resistance by a handful of Palestinian guerrillas in southern Lebanon. Arab regimes have demanded and exacted loyalty but have given few rights of accountability to their citizens. ;;;
