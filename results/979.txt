Text::: Or that Western Europe, despite many differences, disputes and disappointments, could have made such progress in reconciling the ancient enmities of France and Germany and have made such progress toward a Common Market, if not yet toward a common mind. Even a generation ago, it would have been hard to believe that the defeated nations of the Second World War would in 1980 be challenging the United States for supremacy in the export markets of the world, and that the President of the United States, after having maintained an army of over a quarter of a million Americans for over 30 years in Europe, would be meeting with the leaders of Europe, Japan and Canada in Venice to appeal for cooperation in defense of world peace. There are obvious differences between President Carter and his allies here about how to deal with the Middle East, Afghanistan, and the menace of Soviet missiles targeted on Western Europe, but never in the history of the free nations have their leaders met to discuss their common prob-lems as frankly and on terms of such equality as they are doing here this weekend. ;;;
