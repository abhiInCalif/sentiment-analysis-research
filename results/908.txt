Text::: American fundamentalism is limited to some specific issues and obviously doesn't incorporate such parts of the religious heritage as the Golden Rule and the call for charity. Nor is it a revival of the kind of puritanism that led one part of the country to ban ''Demon Rum'' with post-World War I Prohibition, while the other part toasted defiant naughtiness with bathtub gin. Still, the movement wants to restore something found missing. ;;;
