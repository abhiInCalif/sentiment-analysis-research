Syrian support for a stable, unified Lebanon is consistent with expressed American goals, but here again the deep suspicion of Israel makes mutual understanding difficult. Asked whether the United States could help in Lebanon now, Mr. Khaddam said it could ''press Israel to withdraw, and to stop encouraging some Lebanese parties to continue with the game of the civil war.'' ;;;
