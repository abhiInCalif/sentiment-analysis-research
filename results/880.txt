Text::: For Saudi foreign policy, whether directed by Abdel Aziz, his son Faisal, or his son Saud al-Faisal, the Foreign Minister since 1975, holds to a constant set of objectives, though these differ in various areas of the world. Within the Saudis' immediate security zone, whose perimeter includes the Gulf sheikdoms, Yemen and Southern Yemen, the Saudi objective is to intervene as aggressively as needed to maintain the traditional political tribute that their rulers pay Riyadh. To this end, Prince Fahd, along with Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz, the Defense Minister, and Prince Nayef, the Interior Minister, has developed a Gulf security plan, based, according to an unreleased official document, on the principle that ''if the security of one or more states is jeopardized, the collective security of all will be affected.'' ;;;
