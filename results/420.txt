Text::: No one with any dealings in the region, including America, can be immune from violent, often irrational, outbreaks for the simple reason that they are so widespread (not to say applauded) in the Islamic Middle East. And if America is a special target, a ''great Satan'' in the Ayatollah Khomeini's words, it is not because the United States has an alliance with Israel but because it represents values - liberalism, personal freedom, secular government, Western democracy - that seem threatening and abhorrent to many Middle Eastern radicals and religious fanatics. Israel was right to do whatever it could to cooperate with the United States in achieving the release of the American hostages. ;;;
