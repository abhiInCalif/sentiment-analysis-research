Text::: If America had admitted significant numbers of Cambodians, Thailand would perhaps feel under less pressure to repatriate Cambodians. Most of the Khmer refugees who meet Washington's criteria for admittance - those criteria include having immediate family members in America, being at high risk of losing one's life, having had close association with the United States Government - have already been resettled in other countries. Thus, of the 14,000 Indochinese refugees admitted monthly, only about 3 percent are Cambodians. ;;;
