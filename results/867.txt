He points out that Senegal played a key role in the African states' denunciation of the brutal ex-Emperor Bokassa of Central Africa, and now he intends to push for a human rights charter at the Organization of African Unity at its next summit meeting. And it is the man who says all these things, who also strongly supports an African force to make the Libyans quit Chad, who worries about Cubans in Angola, the same man who flatly puts it to the U.S. ''to do all that is possible for a Namibian independence, to bring South Africa to be reasonable and get rid of the odious regime of apartheid.'' ;;;
